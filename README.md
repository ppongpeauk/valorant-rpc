## Before Installation
**rpc-extension.exe** will automatically start the Riot Client/VALORANT in the case that neither programs are found to be a running process. If you do not wish to have it run every time you start VALORANT, simply don't follow the instructions below.

## Installation
1. Extract the zip file provided in the 'Releases' tab
2. Place the extracted folder somewhere that's not temporary (e.g. your games folder)
3. Locate your VALORANT shortcut(s), modify the "Target" property under the "Shortcut" tab to be the full path to the **rpc-extension.exe** executable located in the zip file
